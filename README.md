This is a simple ToDo website made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only.<br>
I had made this website just for practising frontend development.<br>
This website does not use any other framework for backend to create, store and fetch the data.<br>
For Doing simple CRD operations, this website uses javascript only.<br>
This website can be one of the initial website made by a initail programmer who is learning javascript or frontend programming.
